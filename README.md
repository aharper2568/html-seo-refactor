# HTML-SEO-REFACTOR

## Intro

This is a refactor of the Horiseon marketing webpage. Going through the changes in this repository will show the changes made in both the HTML and CSS. While the appearance of the website itself is not changed, the structure is improved and condensed. Below is a user story that depicts the work process through the refactoring.

## User Story
```
As a learning full stack web-developer
I WANT to be sure I can code websites up to accessibility standards
SO THAT I can be trusted with more projects in the future
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage that needs refactoring
WHEN I identify elements with no semantic tag
THEN I improve the elements by making them semantic
WHEN I identify accessibility standard flaws
THEN I restore said flaws by adding identifying attributes
WHEN I identify redundancies in the CSS files
THEN I modify and condense the code to match the HTML
```
